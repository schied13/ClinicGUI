# ClinicGUI
77% of patients recovering from joint replacement procedures do not adhere to post-operative
recovery precautions, leading to an increased chance of re-injury and revision surgery. A
medical device start-up, Goniotape, is in the early stages of developing a wearable alert
system that communicates with patients regarding their spatial movements and alerts them
when they've exceeded their allowable limits. This clinic is constructing a minimum viable
prototype that demonstrates feasibility and can be used to collect clinical data for the partner
company. This project involved using PySide a Python Qt library to implement the following requirements

-The user shall be prompted to select the kind of joint injury present
-The user must be able to start and stop data collection
-The user must be notified when they are breaking the prescribed precautions
-The user must be able to save the data that was collected to a text .txt file
-The GUI must be able to communicate through Universal Serial Bus(USB) or Bluetooth(BLE)
-The GUI must be able to be reset to the startup screen
